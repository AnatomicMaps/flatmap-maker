From Powerpoint to Flatmaps
===========================

Zoomable maps are widely used to view geographical information, and provide a natural way to interact with a large range of different length scales. Within the SPARC MAPcore project, such maps are known as flatmaps and are used to visualise and explore the relationships between organ systems and autonomic nerves. Microsoft Powerpoint is a popular application for drawing diagrams and can be used to prepare flatmaps.

In this talk I intend to give an overview of how flatmaps are used and structured, show how to prepare and annotate a set of Powerpoint slides, and describe the tools for generating a map from these slides.
